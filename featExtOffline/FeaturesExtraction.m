    %Details can be found in the defination of each function
    
    %Object: object of this class is self
    
    %properties:
    
    %1)StartingIndexOffset: this is vector of dimension 1*2
    %first element of vector would be strating index and second index
    %would be starting offset, [startingInd, startingOffset]
    
    %2)EndingIndexOffset: this is the vector of size 1*2
    %first element of vetor would be ending index and second element of
    %list would be ending offset,[endingInd, endingOffset]
    
    %3)behavioralData: is a struct conating all the information regarding
    %trials in different fields. Here'behavioralData.saveData.EventTimes'
    % is field and is used to extract features. This field contains timing
    % information of trails and within trials(event). It is
    % is matrix of size m*n
    % m: total Number of trials
    % n: total Number of events in one trials
    
    %4)NeuralSpikesData:This is a struct and it contain the neural information
    %of trials for one complete session and it has two main fields which
    %are structs
    
    %NEV: This field is a struct and it will contain all the necessary
    %inforamtion to extract unsorted spikes features vectors in its
    %different fields which are of different data types forexample:
    %'neuralSpikesData.NEV.Data.Spikes.TimeStamp' is field of 'NEV'and it is
    %vector of size n*1, where n repesents the time stamps of all spikes in
    % one session. To Extract unsorted spikes features 'nev' struct is used
    
    %sortedSPikes: is a struct and it is in conjuction with 'NEV'struct is
    %used to to extract sorted features vectors. this struct has different one 
    %fields and this filed consis of (n*1) cells where n repesent the number
    %of implanted electrodes(sensors) and each cell contain the sorted spikes
    %information of each electrode.
